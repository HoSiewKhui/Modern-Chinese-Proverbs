得利失亲 (dé lì shī qīn)，提醒人们，当财富的追逐掩盖了亲情的呵护，得到的或许是金钱，却失去了至亲。亲情一旦疏离，再想弥补已非易事。  

阿龙与妻子阿燕是勤劳的父母。他们心想，趁年轻多赚些钱，才算给孩子最好的保障。于是，他们把儿子平日交给保姆照看，只有周末才接回家。时间久了，父子母子之间的亲密逐渐淡薄。  

孩子到了入学年纪，又被送到外州的叔叔家寄住。少了父母的日常陪伴，他学习乏力，成绩下滑，不久便辍学。青少年时期，他混迹于零工与不良圈子，最终走上偷窃之路。  

十五岁时，父母试图劝他回头，但为时已晚。长期的疏忽让孩子变得叛逆，耳边的劝告已不再入心。爱依然存在，但距离早已深深刻下。  

得利失亲 (dé lì shī qīn) 提醒我们，成就不单看你得到了什么，更要看你是否因此失去了珍贵的人。孩子的成长需要陪伴与教导，这份信任与亲情必须从小建立。一时的财富可以以后再积累，但亲情若未曾栽培，或是早已破裂，要再修补便极为困难。  

这句箴言不仅是父母与子女的写照，也关乎我们身边最亲近的人——渴望陪伴的伴侣，盼望照顾的双亲，期待同行的朋友。不要因追逐利益而失去至亲至爱。真正的富足，不只是银行数字的增加，而是仍有人在你身边与你同在。

# 📜 得利失亲 (dé lì shī qīn)  
Gain profit, lose kin

得利失亲 (dé lì shī qīn) warns of the loss that comes when the pursuit of wealth overshadows the bonds of family. Gain in fortune can mean loss in love and once the years of closeness are gone, they cannot easily be reclaimed.  

Ah Loong and his wife, Ah Yan, worked tirelessly. They wanted to earn as much as possible while they were young believing this was the best gift they could give their son. But in chasing money, they left him during the week with a nanny, bringing him home only on weekends. The parent-child bond weakened as the boy grew.  

When school began, he was sent to live with an uncle in another state. Without the guidance of his parents, he struggled. His grades fell, he lost motivation and before long he abandoned his studies. By his mid-teens, he was drifting between odd jobs, drawn into bad company and eventually into theft.  

At fifteen, his parents tried to speak sense into him but it was too late. He had become rebellious, hardened by neglect and no longer listened. Their love was real but the years of absence had already carved the distance.  

得利失亲 (dé lì shī qīn) reminds us that success is not only about what we gain but also about what we may lose in the process. Children need time, presence and guidance from the very start. Wealth can be accumulated later but if the bond of love and trust is not built early, or once it is broken, it becomes very hard to mend.  

This proverb is not only about parents and their children. It is also about the people we hold dearest - a spouse who longs for companionship, ageing parents who hope for care and friends who wish to share life’s journey. Do not let the pursuit of gain cost you the people closest to your heart. True prosperity is found not only in earnings but in the family and loved ones who remain by your side.
