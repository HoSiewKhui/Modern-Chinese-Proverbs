## 引言

在信息唾手可得、连结触手可及的今天，许多人却感到比以往更孤独。  
“网深人远 (wǎng shēn rén yuǎn)” 并非说技术有错，而是提醒我们：  
数字网络越庞大，我们与真实人群、内心情感、生活温度可能反而越来越远。

## 正文

我们用网路代替了面对面交流，用屏幕代替了眼神，用点赞代替了拥抱。  
沉迷于数位世界的连接，最终却换来情感的疏离。

“网深人远” 是一个警钟 —— 不要让你连接世界的工具，变成你与世界之间的障碍。

适度用网，勿深陷网中；善用科技，更要珍惜人情。  
真正的温度，藏在未被忽略的微笑、未被取代的相遇、未被数字吞噬的心跳里。

## English Version

In a world where everything is connected, many feel more disconnected than ever.  
“Wǎng shēn rén yuǎn (网深人远)” means: the deeper we go into the digital web, the farther we drift from real people, real warmth, and real emotion.

We’ve replaced faces with screens, presence with notifications, affection with emojis.  
The more we rely on online networks, the greater the risk of losing the human ones.

This proverb is a quiet alarm bell:  
Don’t let the tools that connect you to the world separate you from it.

Use the web. But don’t get lost in it.
