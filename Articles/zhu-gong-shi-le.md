**逐功失乐 (zhú gōng shī lè)**，道出了一种常见的空虚：当人一味追逐功名，往往换来的不是满足，而是失落。  
一位年轻主管，为了升迁日夜加班，连家人晚餐也少有参与，自我安慰说只是暂时。终于升职了，却没有多少喜悦。他过于沉迷于职场阶梯，连小女儿学走路的第一步都错过了。孩子们逐渐习惯了他的缺席，身体也因过劳而虚弱，眼前的荣耀显得空洞无味。得到了职位，却失去了心灵的喜乐。

箴言提醒我们，雄心并非坏事，奋斗也能成就事业，但若失去节制，反而会模糊人生真正的价值。真正的成功，不在于获得多少，而在于沿途还能守住多少。

**逐功失乐 (zhú gōng shī lè)**，让我们停下脚步，重新思量成就的意义。所谓成就，不只是站上高峰，还要在攀登的过程中，依然带着笑声、亲情与健康。

别为了追功逐利而让生命失去滋味。让工作成为生命的助力，而不是生命的替代。

# 📜 zhú gōng shī lè (逐功失乐) — Chasing success, losing joy

**zhú gōng shī lè (逐功失乐)** warns of the emptiness that follows when ambition consumes life. To pursue achievement without rest or balance is to discover that success has stolen away joy.

A young executive once set his sights on promotion. He worked long hours, skipped family dinners and told himself it was only temporary. The promotion came, yet he found little satisfaction. He had been so absorbed in climbing the ladder that he missed his baby daughter taking her first steps walking. His children had grown used to his absence, his health was fragile and the victory felt hollow. What he gained in title he had lost in spirit.

The proverb reminds us that ambition in itself is not wrong. Drive and determination build progress but unchecked striving can blind us to what matters. Success is not measured by what is gained but by what remains unbroken along the way.

**zhú gōng shī lè (逐功失乐)** calls us to pause and reconsider the meaning of achievement. True accomplishment is found not only in reaching the summit but in the laughter, love, and health we carry with us on the climb.

Do not chase success so hard that you lose the joy of living. Let your work serve your life, not erase it.
