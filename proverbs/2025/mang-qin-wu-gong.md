盲勤无功 (máng qín wú gōng)，提醒人们勤奋若失去方向，再多努力也换不来成果。辛苦本身没有错，但若缺乏智慧与策略，便成了无用功。  

今日社会常谈“内卷”。学校里，学生熬夜到更晚，只因担心同学比自己多读一页书；职场上，加班成了常态，却发现升迁的机会依旧有限。大家都在拼，却没有人真正前进，轮子转得更快，脚步却停在原地。  

有个例子最能说明问题。James 在一家服务型企业工作，他很清楚，要想升职，必须在一群同样优秀、甚至资历更深的同事中突围。单靠辛苦不够，逢迎上司更是早已人满为患。  

James 发现，公司经常需要参加新业务的投标，而这类投标往往需要撰写营销方案和广告策略——既考验写作能力，也考验演示技巧，不是所有人愿意做，更不是所有人做得好。他便每次主动请缨，从中不断积累经验，很快掌握了要领。渐渐地，他形成了自己的“独特卖点”，老板也看见了他的才华。最终，James 的升职在众人之前。  

他不仅肯吃苦，更懂得把努力用在聪明之处，打造了属于自己的优势。  

这句箴言并不是否定勤奋，而是提醒我们：勤奋要配合智慧，才会有收获。光靠蛮干，只是把水倒进破缸。  

盲勤无功 (máng qín wú gōng) 让我们思考：我的努力，是有目的地前行，还是只是盲目随大流？  
别让盲目的勤奋消耗了生命。努力固然重要，但唯有勤与智同行，才会开花结果。

📜 盲勤无功 (máng qín wú gōng)  
Blind diligence yields no merit

盲勤无功 (máng qín wú gōng) warns against effort without direction. Hard work alone is not enough. When diligence turns blind, the result is wasted strength and little reward.  

We see this today in what many call 内卷 (nèi juǎn). In schools, students stay up later and later, afraid their peers will outwork them. In offices, employees push longer hours, only to find promotions still scarce. Everyone works harder yet no one truly gains. The wheel spins faster but it goes nowhere.  

A more telling story comes from James, who worked in a service-oriented company. He knew promotion meant competing with many equally capable colleagues, some with greater seniority. Hard work alone would not distinguish him and even flattery of the boss had long been saturated.  

James noticed that his company often bid for new business through tenders. These required strong marketing and advertising strategies — tasks that demanded skill and confidence in writing and presenting, areas many avoided. He volunteered each time the opportunity arose. Through practice he became skilled, built his own unique selling point and earned the trust of his boss. In time, James was promoted ahead of his peers.  

He had not only worked hard but had worked smart, creating an ability that lifted him above the crowd.  

The proverb does not dismiss diligence. It reminds us that labour must be joined with wisdom. Hard work builds strength but smart work creates results. To toil without strategy is to pour water into a broken jar.  

盲勤无功 (máng qín wú gōng) teaches us to ask: Am I working with purpose or simply working because everyone else is?  
Do not let blind diligence drain your life. Work hard but work smart so that your effort carries fruit and not only fatigue.
