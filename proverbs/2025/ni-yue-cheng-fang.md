## English Version
“逆月称方 (nì yuè chēng fāng)” satirises the act of contradicting common sense simply to appear different or win an argument.  
It teaches us that stubborn opposition is not true wisdom.  

The moon is clearly round, yet some will insist it is square — not out of belief, but to refute others or appear clever.  
Such contrarian behaviour does not show intelligence; it exposes vanity and obstinacy.  
The proverb reminds us to base our views on reason and truth, not on the urge to contradict.
